Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.

## Distance from sun
The Earth is about 93 million miles from the Sun. 

## Year length
It takes 365.26 days for the Earth to go around the Sun. This is called a year.

## Day length
It takes 24 hours for the Earth to spin around once on its axis. This is called a day.

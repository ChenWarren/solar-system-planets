## Introduction
Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but with its larger volume Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) represents his sickle. 

Saturn's interior is probably composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer produces a magnetic field stronger than that of Earth. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth the strength of Jupiter's.

The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph), higher than on Jupiter, but not as high as those on Neptune. There are a number of rings surrounding Saturn, consisting mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. Seven rings are currently known, with the fainter rings being discovered only recently.

## Distance from sun
The average distance between Saturn and the Sun is over 1.4 billion kilometers (9 AU).

## Year length
Saturn takes about 29 years to orbit the Sun.

## Day length
Saturn has a day that is about 10 hours long.

## Fun fact
Saturn's atmosphere is very cold, with temperatures ranging from -178 degrees Celsius (-289 degrees Fahrenheit) at the equator to -187 degrees Celsius (-306 degrees Fahrenheit) at the poles.  
Saturn has a very faint and hard-to-see ring system that was discovered in 1610 by the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. The rings are made up of billions of small pieces of ice and rock.
